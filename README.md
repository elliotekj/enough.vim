# enough.vim

`syntax off` is too little, most other colorschemes are too much. enough.vim
tries to find a happy medium between the two.

> NOTE: At the time of writing (08/01/2020), I’ve only been using this
> colorscheme for about a week. I still consider it to be a work in progress,
> albeit a work in progress that’s fairly far along. Contributions are welcome.
